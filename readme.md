## NOTE
This repo is v1 of stackinwins.com, originally written in vanilla PHP and jQuery to serve interactive UI/UX, with a MySQL database to hold data.
Circa 2022, stackinwins.com was re-written and upgraded in Vue + Vuetify + Firebase (NoSQL) (lives in a separate private repo) — you can see the live vue site [here](https://stackinwins.com).

- ok, i made the /my-wins page
- right now, i have this huge form, taking all daily_wins; but i don't think this will work.
